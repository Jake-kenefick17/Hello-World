## Project Title
**Sample Project – My Repository Template**  
Just trying out a structured README format and getting used to writing documentation that doesn’t feel fake.  



## Description
This project is mainly about practicing GitHub basics and getting more comfortable with how repositories are set up. I’m using this as a way to build good habits early—clean organization, clear explanations, and a place to show what I’m learning.



## Software Used
Here’s what I used (or might use) in this project:

- Python  
- Excel  
- Tableau 


Basically, whatever helps me learn and get the job done.


## Files Used
If the project uses data files, this is where I break them down:

- File names  
- Where to find files  
- What’s in the files 
- Dataset Links 

This section helps keep everything organized
